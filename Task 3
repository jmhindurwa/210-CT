Task 3: Write the pseudocode for a function which returns the highest perfect square which is less or equal to its parameter (a positive integer). Implement this in a programming language of your choice.
def hpsfinder(x):
    z = x
    y = x * x
    while y > x:    	#while y is more than z keep dividing z until you find a perfect square
        z = z //2
        y = z * z
    while y < x:    #while y is less than z add 1 to z until the square is larger than start number
        z = z + 1
        y = z * z
    z = z - 1        # minus 1 and square the result to find the closest perfect square less the start
    y = z * z
    return y

print(hpsfinder(n)) #replace n with starting number
