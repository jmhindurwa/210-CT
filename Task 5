Task 5: Write the pseudocode corresponding to functions for addition, subtraction and multiplication of two matrices, and then compute A=B*C â€“2*(B+C), where B and C are two quadratic matrices of order n. What is the run-time?

MATRIX-ADD ():
	A<-[]
	B<-[]
	IF
 Matrices do not have same amount of elements or structure
			RETRUN FALSE
	ELSE
		Add each element with corresponding element from other matrix
			C<- A+B
				RETURN C


MATRIX-SUBTRACT ():
A<-[]
B<-[]
	IF
 Matrices do not have same amount of elements or structure
			RETRUN FALSE
	ELSE
		Add each element with corresponding element from other matrix
			C<- A-B
				RETURN C
